## WELCOME: 

This is the README.md for Matty Lawhorn's Module 9 Challenge named "Boiler Maker"

I was given <i>some</i> source code but most is from scratch.

## HOW TO:

Run the program in command line and answer the prompts. Hit enter to use the default answers. Afterwards, it will generate a folder with a blank project template. The template will have details filled in based on your responses to the prompts.
